This repository contains the code for my senior research project. 

**Research Goal:** To study and improve current CNN models for plant disease classification. 

Semester 1 focused on reproducing 3 current CNN models: InceptionV3, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet. 

**inceptionv3:** Contains the code for the InceptionV3 model. Trained from scratch. Taken from the Toda-Okura paper: https://spj.sciencemag.org/plantphenomics/2019/9237136/

**mohanty:** Contains the code + folder structure for the AlexNet and GoogLeNet models. Note that only the `80-20/finetune` results (i.e. model was pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and used a train-test ratio of 80:20) were reproduced.
