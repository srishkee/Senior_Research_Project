# Mobile App Classification

To create the mobile application, I used the template provided by tensorflow: https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android

I then replaced the .tflite model file and labels.txt to reflect my own model.

In this folder are the Tensorflow scripts to product the .tflite and labels.txt files, which I modified slightly.
